# 🧁 Dalgona Candy Challenge - Computer Vision Project

This project is a fun and interactive simulation of the popular **Dalgona Candy Challenge** (as seen in *Squid Game*) using computer vision techniques. The challenge involves detecting and processing shapes within a candy disk, testing precision and accuracy in image segmentation and shape recognition.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 📷 Uses **OpenCV** for image processing
- 🔍 Detects and segments candy shapes
- 🟨 Simulates user interaction with the candy (e.g., needle simulation)
- 🎯 Evaluates if the shape is successfully extracted (or broken!)
- 💡 Educational introduction to contour detection, edge detection, masking, and object segmentation
